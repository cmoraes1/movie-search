# About: #
Users can search The Movie Database (www.themoviedb.org) to get information about movies or TV shows. Data is pulled from the Movie Database's API and the results are populated into a collection view. Users can select a movie or TV show to see its release date, language, average rating, and description. They can also add/remove a movie or TV show to their list of favorites.
